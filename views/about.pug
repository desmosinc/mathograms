        p At <a href='http://www.desmos.com'>Desmos</a>, we love math, teachers, and technology, and we think Valentine's Day is the perfect time to share that love with the world.  So here's a Math-o-gram from us to you.
        p While you're enjoying that warm, fuzzy feeling, look at how easy it is to embed that Desmos Math-o-gram into a plain webpage! We've been polishing and perfecting <a href='https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.2/docs' target='_blank'>our API</a> for years so that you can use all the features you love about Desmos anywhere on the web. (Try the movable point. Try it!)
        p If you want to use our technology, or help improve it, please <a href='https://github.com/desmosinc/mathograms' target='_blank'>head to Github</a> where we've open-sourced the whole project. Shoutout to <a href='https://github.com/0p3r4t0r' target='_blank'>0p3r4t0r</a> for help getting us back up and running for 2019.
